# Dart with Flutter
A repository showcasing different dart code examples. I will be working on different code examples. 

# Code examples
The codes will showcase an understanding of variables, the use of for, while, and do..while loops. 
It will further show use of the if...else branches and a basic understanding of functions.
The complex example includes a nested for loop that contains the if..else statements and switch statements.
